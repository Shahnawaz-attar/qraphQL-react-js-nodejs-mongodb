Use REST when:
Your API interactions are relatively simple and follow a resource-based structure.
You need to prioritize caching and have limited flexibility in data retrieval.
Your frontend and backend teams are separate and have distinct requirements.


Use GraphQL when:
Your API interactions are complex and involve multiple data sources or relationships.
You want to minimize over-fetching and under-fetching of data.
You want to provide more flexibility to frontend developers in requesting data.
You need a self-documenting API with introspection.
Your frontend and backend teams can collaborate closely to define a flexible and efficient API.
